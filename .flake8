; F are errors reported by pyflakes, a tool which parses source files and finds 
;   invalid Python code.
; W and E are warnings and errors reported by pycodestyle, which checks your 
;   Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP 8.
; C are violations reported by mccabe, which checks the code complexity of your 
;   Python package against a configured limit.
